# BL_Pipe
The Bristol Leeds Pipeline. This software takes a protein structure and a virtual library of small molecules (including conformers) and passes this through a virtual screening tool to a docking program to predict the best binders. This code uses FastROCS  (OpenEye) as the virtual screening tool and BUDE (here) as the docking program.
